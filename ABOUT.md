# VITAL NOTES ðŸ‘€

* Please learn AdGuard Home's interface before using this list
* Since everyone uses the internet differently please be aware that some initial
manual whitelisting is required

The blocklist:
* is more cleaned up, optimized and better than ever
* is very aggressive so before using this list please ensure that you add your own
"Custom filtering rules" for domains you want to allow
e.g: `@@||nexusmods.com^$important`
* is around 120MB so if you're internet plan is data limited please account for
about 3000MB (3GB) per month, if AdGuard Home is set to update once per day

# Suggestions ðŸ“Œ

Do you have a new host list you'd like to suggest?

Please first check that the list does not already exist in the
[list file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/Filterlist-for-AdGuard/master/filter_list_URLs.txt)
then create an issue.
