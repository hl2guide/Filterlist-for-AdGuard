## About ℹ

This is a very aggressive filter-list that consolidates over __320 lists__ for use in
AdGuard Home (https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardHome).

* It includes the AdGuard's official **AdGuardSDNSFilter**
* It is cleaned, sorted, with duplicates removed

### Latest News (March 5th, 2021)

Please add a fourth part of the blocklist to AdGuard Home as per the
[usage page](https://github.com/hl2guide/Filterlist-for-AdGuard/blob/master/USAGE.md).

### VITAL NOTES 👀

* Please learn AdGuard Home's interface before using this list
* The list is very aggressive so before using this list please ensure that you add your own
"Custom filtering rules" for domains you want to allow
e.g: `@@||nexusmods.com^$important`
* Since everyone uses the internet differently please be aware that some initial
manual whitelisting is required
* The blocklist is around 120MB so if you're internet plan is data limited please account for
about 3000MB (3GB) per month, if AdGuard Home is set to update once per day
* The list is more cleaned up, optimized and better than ever

It's a BIG change so please report any false positives for domains.

### What it Blocks 👁‍

* botnets, crypto-lockers and data miners
* drug sales, enrichments and fake sites
* fake news, invasive telemetry and phishing sites
